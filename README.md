A decentralized file system (DFS) is a type of file system that stores and manages data in a distributed manner across multiple nodes or computers, rather than relying on a centralized server. In a traditional centralized file system, all data is stored on a single server or a set of servers, which can become a single point of failure and a performance bottleneck as the system scales
